    <p className="u-mb-4">
      We are a family run business based in Nottinghamshire. Our team is made up of a web designer, a crafter an opinionated teenager and
      most recently a unsociable cat!
    </p>
    <p className="u-mb-4">
      The crafter gets the ideas, the web designer makes sure that every box measures the correct amount of millimetres and are spaced
      accurately and then the teenagers says whether they are any good or not. The cat just visits when he's hungry! It seems to work quite
      well as long as people stick to their own jobs.
    </p>
    <p className="u-mb-4">
      One of our strengths is the aim of perfection. We won't let an item leave our HQ unless its spot on. Our whole team have the same
      ethos, we create and sell things to a quality we would be happy to purchase ....simple.
    </p>
