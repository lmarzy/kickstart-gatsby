A beautifully designed dry wipe family planner whiteboard.

Keep track of where everyone needs to be and when. Use this planner to organise your life so you never forget anything again!

Simply wipe clean at the end of the week and start new again on Monday.

Can have up to 5 Columns for the A4 whiteboard or 7 for the A3 whiteboard which can be completely personalised.

- Made from very thin aluminium sheets, which make it really lightweight and very sturdy and long lasting.
- Comes with a FREE dry wipe pen (Black) and self-adhesive clip which you can attach to the board if you wish.
- Magnets can be purchased separately if you would like to be able to attach to a fridge.
- If you would like to be able to fix to any wall or door we recommend you purchase our command picture hanging strips. These strips will allow you to stick your board on any smooth surface without nails or fear of damage to the walls.
